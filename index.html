            <p>I am a Minneapolis-based human web designer. These are a couple of paragraphs about myself. We're having fun, I have a personality! My age is irrelevant, since time is just an illusion created by your--I mean our--three-dimensional existence. I have hobbies, including chores, work, and listening to music. I also like animals. My family-unit contains among its members two canines as well as a small human. The small human's name is Theo and he also has hobbies, including jamming food in my nurient orifice. What a scamp! Family life agrees with me, not that you asked, but I thought you'd like to know. I also enjoy telling computers what to do because I think they're a little too high on themselves. Thank you for reading about me!</p>
